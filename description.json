   "description" : "This mod adds a Gyro Sensor that compares the direction of the Gyro Sensor to the direction of the camera of the player.\n\nConnect it to electric engines to create a turret that you can control using your camera. You can also connect it to a logic gate to do some other stuff.\n\nOUTPUTS:\n\n* Yaw (Positive) = Player is looking to the left\n* Yaw (Negative) = Player is looking to the right\n* Pitch (Positive) = Player is looking down\n* Pitch (Negative) = Player is looking up\n* Roll (Positive) = The Gyro's side to the right of 'TOP' is higher than the side to the left of 'TOP'\n* Roll (Negative) = The Gyro's side to the right of 'TOP' is lower than the side to the left of 'TOP'\n\nHOW TO CONNECT:\nDriver's Seat -> Gyro Sensor -> Gyro Outputs -> Electric Engines -> Bearings\n\nHOW TO MAKE A TURRET:\nIt works the best if you apply the Yaw first, then the Pitch and finally the Roll.\nExample: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1428584382",
